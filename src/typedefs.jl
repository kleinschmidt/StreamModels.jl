# How many types do we need?  Original StatsModels has three/four:
# Formula/Terms, ModelFrame, and ModelMatrix.  In this formulation, the Formula
# is basically just an expression, headed by :~.  Combined with a Data.Schema,
# you get a transformed expression that you can use to generate a model matrix
# when combined with a data source.
